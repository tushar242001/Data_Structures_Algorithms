/*   ____________________Stack______________________________
Stack : A stack is a linear data structure in which the insertion of a new element and 
       removal of an existing element takes place at the same end represented as the top of the stack.

The functions associated with stack are:

empty() – Returns whether the stack is empty – Time Complexity : O(1) 
size() – Returns the size of the stack – Time Complexity : O(1) 
top() – Returns a reference to the top most element of the stack – Time Complexity : O(1) 
push(g) – Adds the element ‘g’ at the top of the stack – Time Complexity : O(1) 
pop() – Deletes the most recent entered element of the stack – Time Complexity : O(1)     */

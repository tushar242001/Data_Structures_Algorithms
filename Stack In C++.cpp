/* Stack : A stack is a linear data structure in which the insertion of a new element and removal of an existing element 
           takes place at the same end represented as the top of the stack. 

  Basic Operations in Stack :
            push() to insert an element into the stack
            pop() to remove an element from the stack
            top() Returns the top element of the stack.
            isEmpty() returns true if stack is empty else false.
            size() returns the size of stack.

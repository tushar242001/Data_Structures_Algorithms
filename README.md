# Data Structures and Their Subtypes

## Linear Data Structures

### Arrays
- Static Arrays
- Dynamic Arrays (e.g., Vector in C++)

### Linked Lists
- Singly Linked List
- Doubly Linked List
- Circular Linked List

### Stacks
- Array-based Stack
- Linked List-based Stack

### Queues
- Simple Queue (FIFO)
- Circular Queue
- Deque (Double-ended Queue)
- Priority Queue

## Non-linear Data Structures

### Trees
- Binary Tree
- Binary Search Tree (BST)
- AVL Tree
- Red-Black Tree
- B-Tree
- B+ Tree
- Splay Tree
- N-ary Tree
- Segment Tree
- Trie (Prefix Tree)

### Heaps
- Min-Heap
- Max-Heap
- Binomial Heap
- Fibonacci Heap

### Graphs
- Directed Graph
- Undirected Graph
- Weighted Graph
- Unweighted Graph
- Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)

## Hash-based Structures

### Hash Tables
- Separate Chaining
- Open Addressing (e.g., Linear Probing, Quadratic Probing, Double Hashing)

## Other Specialized Structures

### Sets
- Hash Set
- Tree Set

### Maps
